# Case Study: Influence of Information Diffusion on Epidemic Countermeasures

The course of the COVID-19 pandemic is often modelled mathematically using SIR-like models. Since opinions on certain issues have a significant influence on people's behavior, we have extended the standard SIR model by coupling it with a model that focused on information diffusion or attitudes, modeled analogously to the SIR model. We analyze our model and calculating the reproductive number $R_C$ of the COVID model and $R_{Op}$ of the information diffusion model. We validated and analyzed our model by fitting them to COVID-19 data from the RKI and by performing a sensitivity analysis.
